# Sudoku Solver GUI

This program solves a sudoku puzzle for you using recursion.  
Imports the number from a txt file (an example is included). 
Uses swing to present a gui of the puzzle.  

Sample unsolved puzzle is in text.txt.
Here is an additional one and would look for the program:

...827.19
.6.2.5.7.
......5..
6..3...9.
.32.9.48.
.1...2..7
..6......
.4.1.3.5.
25.689...



Unfortunately since applet has been phased out my java there is no interactive
puzzle.  Javascipt version coming soon.
