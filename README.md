# Sudoku

This program solves a sudoku puzzle for you using recursion.  
Imports the number from a txt file (an example is included). 
Uses swing to present a gui of the puzzle.  

Unfortunately since applet has been phased out my java there is no interactive
puzzle.  Javascipt version coming soon.
