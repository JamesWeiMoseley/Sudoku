# Sudoku Solver GUI

This program solves a sudoku puzzle for you using recursion.  
Imports the number from a txt file (an example is included). 
Uses swing to present a gui of the puzzle.  

Sample unsolved puzzle is in text.txt.
Here is an additional one and would look for the program:

...827.19<br>
.6.2.5.7.<br>
......5..<br>
6..3...9.<br>
.32.9.48.<br>
.1...2..7<br>
..6......<br>
.4.1.3.5.<br>
25.689...



Unfortunately since applet has been phased out my java there is no interactive
puzzle.  Javascipt version coming soon.
